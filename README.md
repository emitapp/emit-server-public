This is the repo that will house all of the server-side logic for 
this Emit, like Cloud Functions and Security Rules.

There's some basic documentation in the docs folder.

Oh and also, if you're using VS Code (I hope you are, haha!), take a look at the recommended extensions in the `.vscode` folder.
